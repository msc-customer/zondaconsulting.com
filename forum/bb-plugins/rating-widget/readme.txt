== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is Rating-Widget different than some other rating widgets, like starrating.org or polldaddy.com? =
It's the best one! The Rating-Widget is without registration, fully customizable, cross-browser & multi-language supported - including Right-To-Left languages support, and of course we host it for free.

= How can I change the default stars style with something else? =
It's very easy. First, go to the Ratings settings. Then, on the Rating-Widget options, select the "Custom" button in the color section, and follow the instructions which will appear in the new window.

= Can my Authors edit my blog ratings? =

Nope. Only administrators can edit the blog ratings.

= The plugin don't work, where are my ratings? =

Check your theme's footer.php calls wp_footer. The rating javascript is loaded on this action. 
More info here - http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Plugin_API_Hooks

= The ratings on the Top-Rated Widget are not being updated, what's wrong? =
Check out if you have any active caching plugins in your WordPress, they might cause this affect.
